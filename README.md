# vue-collect-them-all

## About

It is supposed to be a simple guide to get all achievements for collecting items in the Dark Souls series.
So far, only rings have been made.

## Development

The list of rings was parsed from the wiki and corrected in some places.
The pictures are taken from some guide on steam.
The list of rings is hardcoded. I'll probably use firebase in the future.

There was a pause in the development of 2-3 months, so the style may differ from the previous one.
